# Cataclysm-Fabric

Fabric port of [L_Ender's Cataclysm](https://github.com/lender544/new1.20.1) on 1.20.1 & 1.21.1



**https://bbs.mcmod.cn/thread-21164-1-1.html**

I sincerely realize my mistake.

The two FAQs I posted on Discord contain most of the course of this event. Anyone can go there and read it for themselves and judge right and wrong for themselves.

I'm not going to argue any more about anyone being right or wrong about anything. Pointing fingers at each other is pointless.

My only purpose is to re-communicate with MCL_Ender in order to **resolve the misunderstanding** between us.



I write this article to you:

> I started writing this article right after I left your Discord.
>
> I've been finding methods to communicate with you again. Now I make the Github repo private and archived the CurseForge files as you required.
>
> I **was wrong**. It's wrong to publish without authorization when knowing the license may be in dispute.
> I **swear** I never maliciously exploited the ambiguity of the license to publish my work.
> Fabric porting is not an easy task. It took me more than a month to port. In order to be able to display the boss bars, I even made another additional API mod (Styled Boss Bar API).
> I **believe** there must be misunderstandings.
> Many people told me they desire us to continue to communicate and solve the problem, and I feel the same way. This will be good for everyone.
> I believe can know right from wrong.
> **We both did wrong**. I will never argue the specifics of what was right or wrong. There's no point in pointing fingers at each other.
>
> **I SINCERELY HOPE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU AGAIN.**



**I believe MCL_Ender knows right from wrong.**
